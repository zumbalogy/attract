This is a fractal and attractor drawing playground thing written in clojure/clojurescript/reagent/d3.







# TODO

better seirpinski stuff

more functions

prettier legend

change background colors (maybe have a option to have a changing background, or gradient or user uploaded)

open as png in new tab (need to make background color line up)
https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmedia/2011/01/setting-the-background-color-when-generating-images-from-canvas-todataurl/
var img = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
window.open(img, blank);

better code cleaning and maybe a file for helpers (like one for js/console.log)
